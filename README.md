# My nix config

WIP nix configuration repository that:
* Uses flakes!
* Uses home-manager!
* Supports multiple hosts!

And will eventually (hopefully):
* Expose reusable flake outputs for configurations that sit outside this repo!
* Contain all my important dotfiles!
* Competently configure at least one window manager!
* Have switchable color schemes and templating!
* Have pretty screenshots!

Based on [nix-starter-configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs).
