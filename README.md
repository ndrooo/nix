# My nix config

WIP nix configuration repository that:
* Uses flakes!
* Uses home-manager!
* Supports multiple hosts!
* Uses [i3wm] as a window manager!
* Exposes home-manager flake outputs I use in my work configuration!

And will eventually (hopefully):
* [WIP] Have switchable color schemes and templating!
* Contain all the important dotfiles from my [old repo]!
* Have pretty screenshots!

Based on [nix-starter-configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs).
